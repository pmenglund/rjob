== Welcome to Rjob

Rjob is created out of frustration from using pssh, capistrano and a home
grown tool (written using 1000+ lines of Borne shell, sed and awk) - neither
could satisfy what I needed:
- a framework where I can submit remote jobs to be run on a set of servers
- run things in paralell (with a knob to limit max connections)
- rerun failed jobs (due to system being down/unreachable)
- easy viewing of the result
